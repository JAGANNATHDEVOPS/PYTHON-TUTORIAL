**STEPS IN EXECUTING PYTHON PROGRAM**
1. Write the source code & save it in a filename with extension ".py"
2. Execute the python program in which the following substeps will take place.
   a. Convert the source code into intermidiate code.
   b. Intermidiate code of python is automatically converted into machine understandable code(i.e 0's & 1's)
   c. Processor reads machine code, process it & gives result.
3. If our source code contains any syntactical errors then PVM generates compile time errors.

**IDENTFIERS IN PYTHON**
We know that every input of the program is stored in main memory of computer by allocating sufficient memory space.
To retrive the value from the memory space, the memory space must be qualified with distinct names.
This distinct names makes us to identify the values present in the memory space & they are called identifiers.
Since identifier values are changing during the execution of program & they are also called variables.
Hence every input of the program must be stored in the format of a variable or identifier names.

**DEFINATION OF VARIABLE**
Avariable name is one of the identifier whose value is changing during execution of program.

**RULES FOR USING VARIABLES OR IDENTIFIERS IN PYTHON**
1. In the variable name 1st letter of the variable name must be an aphabet(after alphabet we can use digits also)
2. The variable name should not contain any special symbols(-, $, :, , etc) except _.
3. The length of the variable can be any size.
4. We should not use keyword as variable names(Because keywords are the reserved words which will give some specific meaning to the language compilers).
5. Python variables are case sensitive.

**REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS FOR DEVELOPING PYTHON BASED APPLICATIONS**
1. Software requirements
2. O.S requirements
3. IDE requirements

**NUMBER OF WAYS TO EXECUTE THE PYTHON PROGRAM**
1. By using python cmd prompt
2. By using python IDLE GUI window
3. By using editor
4. By using IDE
